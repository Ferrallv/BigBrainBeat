# Sources & Inspirations

## A huge influence and sparked this projects journey

When I started on the idea of using AI to identify the beat and rhythm of music I
stumbled upon the work of **Liam Schoneveld** whose ideas, insights, and code
heavily inspired and guided my own research and project. Below are links to his
projects.

For the third phase of the model, I used "real-world" music obtained from http://opsound.org.
For each track, the BPM was determined by human input (myself) using a tap tempo (found here:https://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm).
Then the average after 50 taps is used, rounded to the nearest whole. The links to the artists
and the tracks I used are found below, in no partici.
