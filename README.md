# BIGBRAINBEAT README
---
Thank you so much for checking out my project! If you wish to try this at home,
you only need to run the `BigBrainBeat_Presentation.ipynb` with the other files
in the same directory (not including the other `.ipynb`). To change the track,
simply edit the trackpath in the `show_me` function. I encourage you to try your own
recorded samples! Just be sure they are in `.wav` format.

If you are unfamiliar with recording, I recommend https://www.audacityteam.org/
as an excellent open-source starting point.

All of the `.wav` files I used for this project can be found here:
